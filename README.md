# Portfolio

The contents of this repository are a portfolio website for me to use to present my work to prospective employers. It features an About Me section, a Projects section, and a Contact section. Currently, the example projects do not link to anything. As I complete more projects, I will update the page to feature those projects and link to them. The application utilizes a responsive design to accommodate multiple viewport sizes. I imagine that I will make additional aesthetic and functional changes as I become more skilled with HTML and CSS.

The deployed website can be found at: [alextheordinary.github.io/portfolio/](https://alextheordinary.github.io/portfolio/)

This is a screenshot of the completed application:
